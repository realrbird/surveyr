The goal of surveyr is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of surveyr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("realrbird/surveyr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# During package development, use devtools::load_all() instead of library()
# This loads the package functions and data without requiring installation.
devtools::load_all()
#> ℹ Loading surveyr

# Example usage (we will write this function next!)
# survey_df
# target_list
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
